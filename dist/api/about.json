{"id":3,"title":"About","name":"About Me","slug":"about","summary":null,"body":"I am a Jersey girl, born and bred, and a Jersey wedding and family photographer based in the Channel Islands. I was given my first ever camera by my parents when I was 5 years old, and have never looked back! Through my childhood I always knew that photography was to play a big part in my life, so I do feel extremely fortunate it is both my passion and profession.\n\nNowadays, you\u2019ll be glad to know that I have since upgraded from the camera that my parents gave me those many years ago! I have been a wedding and family photographer since 2010, and feel very privileged to have documented incredible weddings locally in our beautiful islands of Jersey and Guernsey, but also to have travelled to destinations such as Hong Kong and Shanghai for my clients. Although I\u2019ve gained National awards for my work, what's important to me is capturing those special moments that will be frozen in time forever and passed down the generations.\n\nI absolutely love capturing those precious moments between a bride and groom, from a hearty giggle during the speeches to a teary look of pure joy as they say their vows. I always feel very privileged and excited at the prospect of covering more weddings and family photoshoots here in Jersey, Guernsey, France and further afield.\n\nNaturally, please feel free to get in touch if you\u2019re looking for a wedding or family photographer to capture your beautiful memories. I always welcome the opportunity to meet with you and chat about your big day.","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"posts":[],"images":[{"id":1277,"path":"\/storage\/images\/a73221ffc3c14a8893d9ea3dbce61b88.jpeg","name":"W-AO-1-13 copy.jpg"}]}
