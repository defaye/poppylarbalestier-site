However, when we sat down to view our wedding photographs \u2013 carefully crafted as a slideshow to music \u2013 we were blown away by the quality. It truly felt as though we had been transported back to our special day and a flood of memories came rushing back with every breath-taking shot. Poppy captured the precious moments between us, from a hearty giggle during the speeches to a teary look of pure joy as we said our vows. \n\nWe were astounded at how beautifully Poppy had captured the atmosphere of the wedding, and she was so discreet that our guests had no idea they were being photographed. Poppy really does have an eye for the best light and backdrop to make the most impressive pictures. Knowing that we didn\u2019t want to take too long for posed shots, Poppy ensured that the family snaps were done efficiently so we could spend more time with our guests. \n\nHer relaxed yet assertive approach resulted in a stunning collection of pictures that are unique to us and our wedding day. Your wedding photographs are something to treasure for years to come so you need to have the best person behind that camera. And Poppy is, in our opinion, the best.","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":493,"path":"\/storage\/images\/50b4f2b6b2fb4bd68947498d6ebb101b.jpeg","name":"W-LC-103_1000x667.jpg"}]}
