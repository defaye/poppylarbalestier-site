It truly felt as though we had been transported back to our special day and a flood of memories came rushing back with every breathtaking shot. Poppy captured the precious moments between us, from a hearty giggle during the speeches to a teary look of pure joy as we said our vows.\n\nWe were astounded at how beautifully Poppy had captured the atmosphere of the wedding, and she was so discreet that our guests had no idea they were being photographed. Poppy really does have an eye for the best light and backdrop to make the most impressive pictures. Knowing that we didn\u2019t want to take too long for posed shots, Poppy ensured that the family snaps were done efficiently so we could spend more time with our guests.\n\nHer relaxed yet assertive approach resulted in a stunning collection of pictures that are unique to us and our wedding day. Your wedding photographs are something to treasure for years to come so you need to have the best person behind that camera. Poppy is, in our opinion, the best.\n\nCarly & Ramsay","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":234,"path":"\/storage\/images\/0a14733322c74f4483bf42da2c26f05a.jpeg","name":"W-LC-103_1000x667.jpg"}]}
