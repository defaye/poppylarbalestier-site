We continue to be delighted with the images that Poppy took and she really helped to make us feel relaxed. Although the weather wasn't great on our Big Day, when we look at Poppy's images, we forget that it was cold and windy, as Poppy really captured our happiness. We really cannot recommend Poppy highly enough - she has a wealth of professional experience and would be our first choice of photographer for any event. Thank you Poppy!","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":553,"path":"\/storage\/images\/cb188a2426824f158b2bd8b02ae91890.jpeg","name":"Website size-622 copy.jpg"}]}
