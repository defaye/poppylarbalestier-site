She manages to capture intimate moments throughout the day without being intrusive or 'in your face'. And the party pics as the night wore on are brilliant, and really capture the joy and fun. She took loads of great photos of our guests, which we really appreciated as the whole day felt like a bit of a whirlwind for us, so we loved seeing how much everyone enjoyed it.","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":544,"path":"\/storage\/images\/2d9acf1c92c3425fa434c5d814d51c7b.jpeg","name":"Website size-57.jpg"}]}
