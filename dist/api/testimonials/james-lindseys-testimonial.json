She faded into the background and from there managed to capture the most exquisite shots.\n\nWe love every single photo from our wedding day and would highly recommend her services to anyone. Thank you Poppy!","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":242,"path":"\/storage\/images\/f34a07a76e4e4d989a75a0b37d14b69f.jpeg","name":"W-LJ-0114_1000x667.jpg"}]}
