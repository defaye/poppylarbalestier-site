{"id":29,"title":"Jen & Alex's Testimonial","slug":"jen-alexs-testimonial","summary":null,"body":"Poppy was a pleasure to work with from start to finish - we are not a couple who loves the limelight but she really put us at ease and we chose her as our wedding photographer on our first meeting together. She suggested a great location, Ouaisne Common, for our post-vows photoshoot and we couldn't have picked a better spot ourselves. \n\nThe photos are absolutely stunning and even 18 months after the wedding we cannot stop admiring them. I would not hesitate to recommend Poppy to others who are looking for an extra-special photographer who wants to work with you to get the best shots possible.","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":541,"path":"\/storage\/images\/ae57bd11a7624915a678ca1db8ae228a.jpeg","name":"W-DM- 147.jpg"}]}
