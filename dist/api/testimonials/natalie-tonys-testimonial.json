{"id":8,"title":"Natalie & Tony's Testimonial","slug":"natalie-tonys-testimonial","summary":null,"body":"We weren't going to have a photographer as really couldn't afford it, but we decided quite last minute that in fact it was something we should fork out for. Thank goodness we did, and thank goodness we found Poppy!\n\nWe've watched the slideshow countless times and it brings back all the memories. We're spoiled for choice on what image to use on our thank you cards, and what prints to have, and considering how much I normally hate photos of myself, this is quite a feat! Poppy has captured special little moments from most of the wedding party, not just the bride and groom.\n\nI think the best compliment I can give is from my good friend who lives in Australia who could not make it to the wedding, she watched the slideshow and said \"Photos are amazing. Such a beautiful wedding. Everything looked perfect, I feel like I was there. You really get a feel for the day from the pictures.","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":235,"path":"\/storage\/images\/388a0c6c1728448bacbba0c67a87c6bc.jpeg","name":"IMG_5550_1000x667.jpg"}]}
