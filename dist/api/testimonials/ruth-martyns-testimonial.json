For us, the most impressive element is Poppy\u2019s understanding of what makes a great wedding photo. She seamlessly and discreetly photographed all of the key members of the wedding party and has a great talent for capturing fantastic moments. \n\nWe were keen not to spend a lot of time posing for photos and Poppy made sure that all the group shots were completed within ten minutes which left more time for us to enjoy the celebrations.  The final result is a set of photos that are relaxed, fun and really capture the day as we remember it.","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":540,"path":"\/storage\/images\/437804d7bb084f89b16b961c12559994.jpeg","name":"Website size-53.jpg"}]}
