Meeting her a month in advance of the weekend was super easy and filled us with even more confidence... and this is all just the run up! On the actual wedding day she was again just so lovely and professional, subtly in the background so much of the time.\n\nWe received our photos in ridiculously good time and with such care and consideration, and we honestly could not be happier with the incredible job she has done with the photos, they are absolutely stunning. Our families and friends are utterly bowled over by them. \n\nPoppy you are amazing, thank you for everything!","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":552,"path":"\/storage\/images\/345269b0bfae4db2a123cc709f5d090d.jpeg","name":"W-HDC-644-8.jpg"}]}
