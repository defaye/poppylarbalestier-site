{"id":10,"title":"Sue & James's Testimonial","slug":"sue-jamess-testimonial","summary":null,"body":"Poppy is a vibrant, imaginative and talented photographer. She played an integral part in our wedding day and made us feel relaxed and almost unaware of her presence. She photographed the ceremony at midday and then returned to take some shots of us on the headland in front of the Atlantic Hotel.\n\nWe are delighted with the results. She has captured the spirit of the day and provided us with the most wonderful memories of a magical time. We have no hesitation in highly recommending Poppy to you.","body_prefix":null,"body_suffix":null,"published":true,"page":{"id":8,"title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials"},"images":[{"id":535,"path":"\/storage\/images\/2afe18f68d354c0986ad38ebe0ddb98f.jpeg","name":"Website Becky-2.jpg"}]}
